The Low-power Embedded Networked Systems (LENS) group is a team of researchers at Graz University of Technology focusing on future connected wireless embedded systems, aiming to make them more dependable and sustainable. The team's activities can be broadly characterized as "systems and application-driven experimental research" at the intersection of wireless networking, embedded systems, and IoT applications.

Exemplary research challenges tackled within the group include:  
• dependable communication despite harsh environmental conditions;  
• development of testbeds and tools for quantitative benchmarking;  
• robust and scalable ultra-wideband localization and communication;  
• detection and mitigation of radio interference as well as jamming attacks;  
• cross-technology communication, coordination, and synchronization;  
• low-latency communication in the mesh-cloud continuum;  
• energy-efficient operations towards zero-power and sustainable IoT systems;  
• highly-performant and fault-tolerant wireless mesh networks.
